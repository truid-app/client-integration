            A 202 response is returned instead of a 302 response if the client
            is passing the header `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`. This is
            used because some clients cannot handle manual redirect on 302
            responses.
            
            A 202 response is to be treated exactly as a 302 response.
